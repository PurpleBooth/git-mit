## Pull Requests

Pull requests are, a great way to get your ideas into this repository.

When deciding if I merge in a pull request I look at the following
things:

### Does it state intent

You should be clear which problem you're trying to solve with your
contribution.

For example:

> Add lint for Pivotal Tracker

Doesn't tell me anything about why you're doing that

> Add a lint for Pivotal Tracker. Pivotal Tracker is a popular issue
> tracking system. We should support checking to see if the ID is there
> as this something I miss every day.

Tells me the problem that you have found, and the pull request shows me
the action you have taken to solve it.

### Is it of good quality

- Are there unit tests
- Are there end-to-end tests
- Has the documentation in [docs](./README.md#docs) been updated
- Are the lints all passing
- Is the pull request reasonably small, or split over multiple

### Does it move this repository closer to my vision for the repository

The aim of this repository is:

- We aim to be easy to use
- We aim to include lints that developers in large organisations need,
  but not have hundreds of them
- We aim to encourage and advocate for pair programming
- To provide an alternative to git duet

Git duet is fantastic, but hard to use, and hard to add additional lints
to.

### Does it follow the contributor covenant

This repository has a [code of conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md), This
repository has a code of conduct, I will remove things that do not
respect it.
